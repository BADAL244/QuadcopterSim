Simulation of a Quadcopter  

`Quadcopter_6DOF_Sim.ipynb`  
Numerically integrates the 6DOF nonlinear equations of motion for hardcoded propeller inputs.  

`Quadcopter_Linear_Sim.ipynb`  
Expands upon the 6DOF simulation and adds a linear state space model for comparison against the nonlinear simulation.
